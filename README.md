# V60 Brew Assist
 
The routine of making coffee with the V60 pour over is something I look forward to each morning. And so, this web application was started not only as a way to learn React, but to also help me explore different brewing methods on the V60. 

The objective of the application is to allow for customized step-by-step instructions for popular brewing methods. Prompts will be shown alongside the timer so that the user will know when each step takes place.
